# Football (soccer) results

### In this project I used some important data analysis skills to download, proccess and visualize some soccer data. All the project is developed in R language and some tidyverse packages. In a first moment I explored the points obtained by brazilian teams in the first division of the national championship (Brasileir√£o) making an animated plot with the temporal evolution with the top 10 teams with more cummulative points since 2003 (the first year in the actual format).

# Web scraping:
Get the results from [worldfootball](worldfootball.net) (the code could be used for download any league in an easy way) and the logos from [escudosfc](https://www.escudosfc.com.br/bras2022.htm).

Files:
- [download_results.r](R/download_results.r)
- [utils.r](R/utils.r)
- [getting_logos.r](R/getting_logos.r)

# Data wrangling and plot:
Proccess the data in a tidy way for filter transform and plot the data. The [animated plot](animated_plot.mpeg) was made with ggplot and gganimate.
